# Medical Insurance Project

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook file titled "Medical_Insurance_projects.ipynb" and a dataset file named "insurance.csv." The purpose of this project is to perform various regression analyses on the provided dataset to predict medical insurance charges. 

## Project Details

### Files

1. **Medical_Insurance_projects.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook contains the code and explanations for various regression models applied to the dataset to predict medical insurance charges. The code in this notebook is organized in a step-by-step manner to facilitate understanding and reproducibility.

### Dataset

- **insurance.csv**: This dataset contains information related to medical insurance charges. The columns in the dataset include:
  - Age: Age of the insured person (numerical)
  - Sex: Gender of the insured person (categorical: 'male' or 'female')
  - BMI: Body Mass Index of the insured person (numerical)
  - Children: Number of children/dependents covered by the insurance (numerical)
  - Smoker: Smoking status of the insured person (categorical: 'yes' or 'no')
  - Region: Region where the insured person resides (categorical: 'northeast,' 'northwest,' 'southeast,' 'southwest')
  - Charges: Medical insurance charges (numerical, target variable)

### Regression Models Used

The dataset provided is a numerical dataset, and the following regression models have been applied to predict medical insurance charges:

1. Linear Regression
2. Ridge Regression
3. Lasso Regression
4. ElasticNet
5. Decision Tree Regression
6. Random Forest Regression
7. Gradient Boosting Regressor
8. Support Vector Regression (SVR)
9. Huber Regressor
10. Least Angle Regression (LARS)
11. Bayesian Ridge Regression
12. Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP)

## Getting Started

To reproduce the results and explore the code and analyses in detail, please follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   git clone <repository_url>

2. Ensure you have the required libraries and dependencies installed. You can find a list of common Python libraries for data analysis in the notebook's introductory section.
